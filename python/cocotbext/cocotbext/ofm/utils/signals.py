    Filters the input bytes by a given bitmask.

    data (bytes): The input bytes to filter.
    byte_enable (int): An integer used as a bitmask to determine which bytes to include

    bytes: A new bytes object consisting of elements from the input based on
           the bitmask. Only bytes at positions where the corresponding bit in
           'enable' is set to 1 are included.
