        If the value of the signal is already set to passed value, function returns immediately.

    Args:
        signal: signal that is to be awaited, must be signal from the cocotb.bus class.

def filter_bytes_by_bitmask(data: bytes, byte_enable: int) -> bytes:
    """
    Filters the input bytes by a given bitmask.

    Parameters:
    data (bytes): The input bytes to filter.
    byte_enable (int): An integer used as a bitmask to determine which bytes to include
                  in the output. Each bit in the mask corresponds to an index in
                  the data; if a bit is set to 1, the corresponding byte is included
                  in the result.

    Returns:
    bytes: A new bytes object consisting of elements from the input based on
           the bitmask. Only bytes at positions where the corresponding bit in
           'enable' is set to 1 are included.

    Example:
    >>> filter_bytes_by_bitmask(b'hello', 0b10101)
